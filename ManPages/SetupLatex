To change the default search directory for personal packages change the following file:
/usr/local/texlive/2016/texmf.cnf
In the TEXMFHOME variable set it to the desired path. Note that the default path was:
~\texmf\tex
Note further that there is a hierarchy structure for further stuff that can be found in one of the websites that is bookmarked in Chrome.
