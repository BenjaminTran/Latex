	\section{Cellular Function\supdag}
	
	\subsection{Structural Protein\supdag}
	
	The primary structural proteins in the body are \begin{labeling}{Collagen}
		\item [\textbf{Collagen}]  Makes up most of the extracellular matrix of connective tissue. Provides strength and flexibility.
		\item [\textbf{Elastin}] (extracellular matrix) Primarily stretch and recoil like a spring to restore original shape of tissues
		\item [\textbf{Keratin}] Intermediate filament proteins found in epithelial cells. Hair and nails
		\item [\textbf{Actin}] makes up microfilaments and thin filaments in myofibrils. Has both positive and negative charges $ \implies $ motor proteins travel unidirectionally.
		\item [\textbf{Tubulin}] Makes up microtubules whcih provide structure, chromosome separation in mitosis and meiosis, and intracellular transport. Has polarity: negative end adjacent to nucleus, positive end in periphery
	\end{labeling}
	
	Structural proteins usu. have repetitive organization of secondary structural elements called a \textbf{motif}.
	
	\subsection{Motor Proteins\supdag}
	
	\emph{Display enzymatic activity}, acting as \textbf{ATPases} that power the conformational change necessary for motor function. Transient interactions with either actin or microtubules. \textbf{Myosin} - primary motor protein that interacts with actin. It is the thick filament in a myofibril and is involved in cellular transport. Has one head and one neck. \textbf{Kinesins} and \textbf{dyneins} are the motor proteins associated with microtubules. Has two heads, one remains attached to tubulin at all times. Both important for vesicle transport: kinesins bring vesicles toward positive end of microtubule and dyneins negative end. 
	
	\subsection{Binding Proteins\supdag} 
	
	Include hemoglobin, calcium-binding proteins, DNA-binding proteins, etc. Usually transport or sequester molecules. Have different dissociation curves based on role.
	
	\subsection{Cell Adhesion Molecules\supdag}
	
	\textbf{CAMs} integral membrane proteins found on surface and allow cells to bind to the extracellular matrix of other cells. Three major families:
	\begin{description}
		\item[\textbf{Cadherins}] mediate calcium-dependent cell adhesion, usu. hold similar cell types together, each cell type has different type.
		\item[\textbf{Integrins}] Have two membrane spanning chains $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ important for binding and communicating with extracellular matrices (cell signaling).
		\item[\textbf{Selectins}] Unique in binding(weakest) to carbohydrates that project from other cell surfaces.
	\end{description}

	\subsection{Immunoglobulins\supdag}
	
	\textbf{Antibodies} are produced by B-cells. Y-shaped with heavy and light chains held together by disulfide linkages. Three possible outcomes from binding of antigen:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Neutralize the antigen
		\item \textbf{Opsonization} - Mark for destruction by white blood cells
		\item \textbf{Agglutinating} - Clumping into large antigen-antibody complexes for phagocytosis by macrophages.
	\end{enumerate}

	\section{Biosignaling\supdag}
	
	Proteins participate in biosignaling by acting as extracellular ligands, transporters for facilitated diffusion, receptor proteins, and second messengers. Can have functions in substrate binding or enzymatic activity.
	
	\subsection{Ion Channels\supdag}
	
	\textbf{Ion channels} are proteins that create specific pathways for charged molecules. \textbf{Facilitated diffusion}, a type of passive transport, the diffusion of molecules (large, polar, or charged) down a concentration gradient through a pore created by a transmembrane protein. Three types of ion channels.
	
	\begin{description}
		\item[\textbf{Ungated Channel}] 	No gate and thus no regulation.
		\item[Voltage-Gated Channels] 	Regulated by the membrane potential change near the channel.
		\item[Ligand-Gated Channels] Regulated by binding of specific substance or ligand.
	\end{description}
	
	Note that enzyme kinetics can be applied to these ion channels and in general all transporters.
	
	\subsection{Enzyme-linked Receptors\supdag}
	
	\textbf{Enzyme-linked receptors} are membrane receptors with three primary protein domains: membrane-spanning domain, ligand-binding domain, and catalytic domain. Often results in \textbf{second messenger cascade}. \emph{Receptor tyrosine kinases} are a classic example.
	
	\subsection{G Protein-Coupled Receptors\supdag}
	
	\textbf{G protein-coupled receptors} - a large family of integral membrane proteins involved in signal transduction. 7 membrane-spanning $ \alpha $-helices. GPCRs utilize a \textbf{heterotrimeric G protein}. Three main types of G proteins:
	\begin{description}
		\item[$ \boldsymbol{G_{s}} $] stimulates adenylate cyclase $ \implies $ increase in cAMP
		\item[$ \boldsymbol{G_{i}} $] inhibits adenylate cyclase
		\item[$ \boldsymbol{G_{q}} $] activates phospholipase C, which cleaves a phospholipid from the membrane to form \chemfig{PIP_{2}} which is cleaved into DAG and \chemfig{IP_{3}} which can open calcium channels in the endoplasmic reticulum, increasing calcium in the cell.
	\end{description}
	
	Inactive form, $ \alpha $-subunit bound to GDP, activates when $ \alpha $-subunit GDP phosphorylated to GTP, subunit dissociates, affects adenylate cyclase based on s or i version, loses \chemfig{P_{i}} and associates with G protein complex to become inactive again.
	
	\section{Protein Isolation\supdag}
	
	\subsection{Electrophoresis\supdag}
	
	Uses electric field to separate charged molecules based on net charge, z, and size. \textbf{Migrational velocity, v,} is given by:
	\begin{equation}
	v = \dfrac{Ez}{f}
	\end{equation}
	
	Polyacrylamide gel is the standard medium for protein electrophoresis. It is slightly porous thus allowing smaller molecules to travel faster through the gel than larger ones.
	
	\subsubsection{Native PAGE\supdag}
	
	\textbf{Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE)} is a method for analyzing proteins in their native states. Limited by the varying mass-to-charge and mass-to-size ratios of cellular proteins. Most useful to compare molecular size or charge of proteins known to be similar in size.
	
	\subsubsection{SDS-PAGE\supdag}
	
	\textbf{Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)} separates on mass alone. Like PAGE but adds SDS detergent to disrupt all noncovalent interactions and make the samples all negatively charged to a magnitude proportional to their mass.
	
	\subsubsection{Isoelectric Focusing\supdag}	
	
	\textbf{Isoelectric focusing} separates on the basis of a protein's pI. Using a gel with a pH gradient, the electric field moves the charged proteins until they reach the pH at which they become neutral (pI). The anode must be on the acidic end, remember by (\chemfig{H^{+}}) is positive, and the electrode bust be on the basic end.
	
	\subsection{Chromatography (see organic chemistry)\supdag}
	
	See Organic Chemistry Review.
	
	\section{Protein Analysis\supdag}
	
	\subsection{Amino Acid Composition\supdag}
	
	Amino acid composition determined by protein hydrolysis and subsequent chromatographic analysis, not for sequencing. For sequence of small proteins (50 to 70) use \textbf{Edman degradation}. Sequentially removes N-terminal amino acids. For large proteins use chymotrypsin, trypsin, and cyanogen bromide.
	
	\subsection{Activity Analysis\supdag} 
	
	Activity generally determined by monitoring a known reaction with given concentration of substrate and comparing to a standard. Reactions with a color change allow for rapid identification of samples.
	
	\subsection{Concentration Determination\supdag}
	
	Concentration determined almost exclusively through spectroscopy. Proteins usu. have many aromatic side chains thus analyzed with \textbf{UV spectroscopy}. Colorimetric change reactions include \textbf{bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA), Lowry reagent assay, \emph{Bradford protein assay}}.
	
	\subsubsection{Bradford Protein Assay\supdag}
	
	Uses Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye which originally is brown-green. Loses protons to ionizable groups in the protein and turns blue in the process. Absorbance is measured to create a \emph{standard curve}. Then unknown sample is exposed to same conditions and concentration is determined based on the standard curve. Accurate only when one type of protein is present in solution. Limited by presence of detergent or excessive buffer.
